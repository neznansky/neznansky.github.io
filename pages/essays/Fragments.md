# Magic: controlling the world with words

The notion of words being able to control the world are as old as history, appearing in Mesopotamian myth. Magic is seen as unnatural, supernatural –– of course, most people cannot affect the world through words –– foremost an ability of the gods, though also that of holymen who use incantations and rituals in order to influence the world, mostly through communication with the gods. The Bible starts with god creating light by saying "there will be light". Priests and religoius people employ prayer –– again a verbal invocation –– to bid god, to bless themselves and others. 

> Second, the term "public" signifies the world itself, in so far as it is common to all of us and distinguished from our privately owned place in it. This world, however, is not identical with the earth or with nature, as the limited space for the movement of men and the general condition of organic life. It is related, rather, to the human artifact, the fabrication of human hands, as well as to affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made world together. To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time.[^ArendtWorld]

[^ArendtWorld]: Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition, second edition, p. 52.

Perhaps in some way something like "magic" did likewise exist at least as long as history did. If one indeed thinks of "the world" not as nature and the earth, but the World of Men, then indeed words have had exercised much control over it. What is a ruler if not a person who controls the world through words? He does not plough the earth but makes the earth be ploughed for him; he doesn't necessarily involve himself in battle and yet "he conquers".

Recent years saw the emergece of a new world, a substitute world, where something like magic is "natural" to it rather than supernatural. This world, the "virtual world" of the internet, ever increasingly occupies the minds of humans, and is errected solely through language, even if it is upheld by infrastructure that exists in the natural world. This language is programming language rather than human language (a distinction that is not unlike that between magic spells and prosaic language), and nonetheless it is manmade.<br/>
In the movie *The Matrix*, Neo –– who is the praogammer and hacker Thomas Anderson outside the Matrix –– gains control over the world by realizing its illusory nature – "there is no spoon". There's an inversion in this film: the world that we know outside the movie becomes a fictional one, the simulated output of machines, while the fantastical world where machines had taken over the world and enslaved humanity is the "real world", where humans are feeble and magic does not exist. But perhaps there's a certain similar inversion happening in the "real world" too. As the meaningful order of the world becomes larger, as the significance of the good will of friends and of the relationship with family members shrinks vis-à-vis world politics, the internet as a medium between the individual and the world and its order rises in dominance.<br/>
But this world, again, is manmade and is controlled by men. While words are epiphenomenal to the earth, as it were, they are that which creates the world of the internet. In this world things can be created out of nothingness through words, for, indeed, the only substance of this world are words. Unlike goats, chairs, houses or grazing rights, things are being sold there that had not been in existence until the very moment of exchange. A person buying a "premium account", or a player buying some fancy item in an MMORPG, is gaining something that might be to his advantage, but which is as fictional as the world he is interacting with. Something is being given, but nothing had been taken away.
