# Magic: controlling the world with words

The notion of words being able to control the world are as old as history, appearing in Mesopotamian myth. Magic is seen as unnatural, supernatural –– of course, most people cannot affect the world through words –– foremost an ability of the gods, though also that of holymen who use incantations and rituals in order to influence the world, mostly through communication with the gods. The Bible starts with god creating light by saying "there will be light". Priests and religoius people employ prayer –– again a verbal invocation –– to bid god, to bless themselves and others. 

> Second, the term "public" signifies the world itself, in so far as it is common to all of us and distinguished from our privately owned place in it. This world, however, is not identical with the earth or with nature, as the limited space for the movement of men and the general condition of organic life. It is related, rather, to the human artifact, the fabrication of human hands, as well as to affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made world together. To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time.[^ArendtWorld]

[^ArendtWorld]: Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition, second edition, p. 52.

Perhaps in some way something like "magic" did likewise exist at least as long as history did. If one indeed thinks of "the world" not as nature and the earth, but the World of Men, then indeed words have had exercised much control over it. What is a ruler if not a person who controls the world through words? He does not plough the earth but makes the earth be ploughed for him; he doesn't necessarily involve himself in battle and yet "he conquers".

Recent years saw the emergece of a new world, a substitute world, where something like magic is "natural" to it rather than supernatural. This world, the "virtual world" of the internet, ever increasingly occupies the minds of humans, and is errected solely through language, even if it is upheld by infrastructure that exists in the natural world. This language is programming language rather than human language (a distinction that is not unlike that between magic spells and prosaic language), and nonetheless it is manmade.<br/>
In the movie *The Matrix*, Neo –– who is the praogammer and hacker Thomas Anderson outside the Matrix –– gains control over the world by realizing its illusory nature – "there is no spoon". There's an inversion in this film: the world that we know outside the movie becomes a fictional one, the simulated output of machines, while the fantastical world where machines had taken over the world and enslaved humanity is the "real world", where humans are feeble and magic does not exist. But perhaps there's a certain similar inversion happening in the "real world" too. As the meaningful order of the world becomes larger, as the significance of the good will of friends and of the relationship with family members shrinks vis-à-vis world politics, the internet as a medium between the individual and the world and its order rises in dominance.<br/>
But this world, again, is manmade and is controlled by men. While words are epiphenomenal to the earth, as it were, they are that which creates the world of the internet. In this world things can be created out of nothingness through words, for, indeed, the only substance of this world are words. Unlike goats, chairs, houses or grazing rights, things are being sold there that had not been in existence until the very moment of exchange. A person buying a "premium account", or a player buying some fancy item in an MMORPG, is gaining something that might be to his advantage, but which is as fictional as the world he is interacting with. Something is being given, but nothing had been taken away.

# Political Legitimacy 
At least since the Enlightment, legitimacy has been discussed by political philosophers. Some said it came from god, others said it came from the people, yet others ascribed its source in certain principles. Yet all treatments I have thus far encountered seem to me to be misguided. <br/>
As a point of departure, I'd like to start with the word itself. Ultimately, the word comes from the word for "law". That is, soemthing is legitimate if it's legal, lawful. However, "legitimate" is not the same as "legal"; the latter denote whether an action agrees with the laws of an existing government, while "legitimate" refers to some loftier frame of reference. Wikitionary currently defines "legitimate" as:<br/>
1. In accordance with the law or established legal forms and requirements.
2. Conforming to known principles, or established or accepted rules or standards; valid. 
3. Authentic, real, genuine. 
4. Lawfully begotten, i.e., born to a legally married couple. 
5. Relating to hereditary rights.

Among these, the second is probably the relevant one. What all these political philosopher discuss, promote and reject are different principles by which to judge one or the other government. I think the error starts here.<br/>
The issue, I'd say, is that law is derived from the state, its significance depends on the existence of the state. That an action I committed was illegal is significant only so far as there is a government which enforces the law. Whether I judge that some action I or another committed was "lawful" or "not lawful" is completely insignificant; if there's a government then it would be their judgement that matters, and if there isn't one then the modifier "lawful" is altogether meaningless. <br/>
Since there is no almighty enforcer outside of governments, there is likewise no real sense in which one could say a government is legitimate. Who is to judge? It only makes sense if one believes that there is a god who makes such judgement. Locke's assertion that it's the people who give legitimacy to the government only makes sense as a response to those who preceeded him and who ascribed the source of legitimacy to god, as an answer that refutes the common conventioon. <br/>
Now, you may say I'm merely playing with words, but I think this word does influence the way that people concieve this issue. You might say that the question whether some system of government is legitimate or not is simply the question whether one shoiuld find it "acceptable". But I don't think you get very far by saying that. What does it matter, or, even, what does it even mean for a government to be "acceptible"? If Alice makes an offer to Bob, he might either accept or reject it. But the governed are not a single united agency, and they cannot accept or reject anything by any means. That some elements thereof can unite and topple the government is another matter. Look at Brexit. 

What makes a nation a unit is the coordination of its people. What makes Germany Germany and France France, and what makes each not the other, is that every person within each of their boundaries behaves as if she was part of that one nation. The Germans speak German and obey German laws, the French obey French laws. If all Germans suddenly behaved as if Alsace was part of Germany, and if all the people of Alsace behaved as if Alzace was part of Germany, then Alzace would become part of Germany and nothing could have been done by France to change that short of bringing the army which would have perceiced by German as an incursion. But, of course, such magical instantanious changes of heart are not possible ––– which is a main part of my treatise here. 

For a very long time I was buffled by the phenomena of conquering (one nation taking over another) and of coups d'état. How can a group of people take over a whole country by simply entering and wreaking havoc by entering a single building, i.e. the seat of government? Surely, these are not always successful. But sometimes they are. How so?<br/>
Of course, one cannot take over a country unless it's already in existence, and therein lies the answer. A whole bureaucratic mechanism is already in place and one simply replaces –– often by applying violence –– the "top". Everybody else behaves as they have before. Going to work, going to the store, obeying laws, paying taxes. The taxman ultimately takes the money to somebody else, but in some sense it is of no concern to the taxpayer. Laws, too, might change; these changse might be to the liking or to the disliking to any one citizen, but before the coup they were not obeying the law because they necessarily thought the law was good, but becuase the law was enforced and disobeying it would incure penalties. Policemen might choose to quit their job but then they would have to look for a new job. Or they might choose to stay, serving a new government. Voila.<br/>
The entirety of the population might think the new government being bad, but they are not telepathic and therefore incapable of carrying out the required coorinated action/behaviour to undo the take over. It is only a select number of people who act under the gun barrel of the new regime, but everybody has something to lose. A worker that strikes will lose his livelihood. Had all workers striked at once, or, more simply, refused to pay taxes, in protest, the usurpers would be ousted; you cannot lockdown or shoot down everybody, and even if you could, there would be little advantage in taking over the government (unless, as an external conqueror, what you sought was strictly speaking territory) –– but, again, people are not telepathic and therefore incapable of such coordination.<br/>
The word "such" above stands for "instantanious", "absolute", "precise" and "all encompassing", for humans, as in the Germany and France example above, are capable of coordination in general. This coordination depends on its conceptualization in the minds of the coordinated, and its alteration is mediated through language.

# Consumer unions

A trade union betters the working conditions of its members by being making decisions on their behalf. For example, as far as wages are concerned, it is the union that bargains with the employer rather than the individual. There's necessarily a gap between the lower rate at which a worker is willing to work and the higher rate at which it would still be profirtalbe for the employer to employ. By voluntarily forgoing his autonomy (and relying on the fact that others in his trade do the same) the worker strenghtens his bargain power. The "choice"/ push for a higher wage is not his own insistance, but a collective, Workers have an insentive to join a union as it furthers their interests, and employers have an interest to employ as the employment is still beneficial to them. 

One of the big issues facing the solution/ mitigation of climate change and other environmental problems is that legislation is very slow, and, therefore, there is not enough collective action. A "consumer" who things that it is completly insignificant vis-à-vis the environment whether he recycles or not, whether he drives a fossil-fueled car, an electric car or simply bikes, is correct. It is insignificant. My decision to take a backpack to the supermarket to avoid usinng a nylon bag does not affect at all the packing decisions of other supermareket goers.[^SupermarketBag] My deccision to use less electricity at home does not affect other home owners. And everybody know that. Writing opinion pieces in the newspaper would not change that one bit. The daily consumption of nylon bags is governed by millions of independent decisions, ndt by mine or yours.

What if, on the other hand, consumers unionized? What if their purchasing decisions were collective, so that they could as one decide to boycot a product because its producer heavily pollutes or because it's packaged in unnecessary amount of plastic packaging, or boycott a supermarket because it offers nylon bags? If such a union is big enough, it would be the producers' and distributers' interests to comply with such demands.

[^SupermarketBag]: Potencially it would inspire witnesses to do the same, but that's a very small footprint. 

This idea has many issues.<br/>
First, while, as is mostly the case in modern times, employers and employees have a contract ~~~~ {rendering} the relationship between them, no such contract exists between buyers and sellers; the market is free. 
Second, unlike the case of trade unions, here it is not a win-win situation for the union's members. While a worker who doesn't unionize might find a deal with an employer quicker, ultimately it would be to his disadvantage. On the other hand, it would be usually to the advantage of consumers to break-off their unions and, for example, buy the less expensive or more convenient but less status-quo friendly product. <br/>
In order for such consumers unions to be viable they must provide an advantage for their members. This advantage can be ideological –– giving a sense to their members of making a significant ecological change –– but given the economical system in place, that advantage would probably have to eventually[^EventualAdvantage] be economical as well, whatever the shape of that advantage be. 

[^EventualAdvantage]: I say eventually because I suppose that it might be dependent on the current size of the union. For example, it might be that initially these unions would attact mostly people motivated by ideology, but once the unions become strong enough that they can bend the arms of manufacturers and distributers, they would also gain an angle that would allow them to guarantee an advantage to their members, for example by guaranteeing certain commodity prices. Alternatively, that advantage might come in the form of social relations.

# Emergence of vocal language

Breathing provides humans the oxygen required to their metabolism. Certain states affect and alter the rhythm of breathing; exertion demands faster circulation and therefore faster breathing. <br/>
Breathing also happens to be audible. Given the relationship between state and breathing, hearkening another's breathing pattern might provide useful information. Could it be that such an attention to the breathing of others has evolve among humans and then also paved the way for the evolution of the faculties that made language possible?<br/>
Nowadays many inhalations and exhalations are very expressive: gasping, sighing, huffing, yawning, snickering.
