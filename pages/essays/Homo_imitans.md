People have a creative impulse to recreate what's around them
Specifically, that which they enjoy




History books are enjoyed, and a person wants to imitate them. How "true" the account (text) is is orthogonal to the enjoyment of the piece. The truthfulness is useful, not enojoyable. Instrumental, not aesthetic.
Reading a good book, a person motivated by a creatiev impulse would want to recreate it, also if in the form of fiction.
Hence Tolkien's Apendices at the end of Lord of the Ring. Like a neural network that is trained on data to be able to generate it, Tolkien was inspired by ancient epic songs and sagas (and the contemporary books presenting them) and "generated" something off the top of his head.
The drive to imitate employs no analysis. One does not analyze why something was a source of joy, but simply tries to imitate it wholesale.

craft vs art
modern bad having a bad repute because there were early pieces that were artistic but lack craftiness, but thenceforth other "artists" immitated these.. that is, they didn't have the art but they imitated the (lack of) craft, resulting in crappy pieces that are neither beautiful nor meaningful.
