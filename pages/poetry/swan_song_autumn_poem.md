Swan Song// Autumn Poem




If winter is life's death
then curious, that autumn, 
life dying
be so gorgeous
God's fire that doesn't quench 
red on the branches, red on the leaves,
yellow on the benches, yellow in the drenches,
yellow high, yellow fever, 
drainage orange orange range,
crimson in the air, crimson in the crushed
like wine crimson in the nose trails, traces
crimson in the crows' cries
cra, cra 
they announce
look, open your mouth 
the earth is dying ablaze 
you can hear it if you try 
you can heart it whispering
livid rain like 
thunder lightning thunder 

oh why is the dying so beautiful
nature is leaving,
yet draws its full spirit to amaze
in concert, a long exhale
just
for that very moment
univocal universe
an ocular maze, tesselated
to be splendid 
oh why, and what for
and how somehow 
the dying spectacular 
IS the very living 

 * 

Oh, he said, you meant live alone
he asked me back, but he already knew
what I had meant
And I already knew
how we all die
how we all dead
blessed white, cold and wet

or this is how it used to be 
now it's all gone raving mad
now winter itself is dying 
spins off the hinges
spins off the wool
snip, snap 
clips one of the three fates (the spindle)
quiet and cool
as if ever dying was 
so 
quiet and cool 
or was a birth
or beautiful 
like a snow-white nap 
for resting

ere the loom hypnotized us
into textile metaphors
we each a string
to each to tell a yarn
nice meter, closing rhyme.
now machine is something different
we are words, thumbnail tile
data text, data jpeg
churning meta data for
random trees
random forests -- have you ever seen one burning? 
are we thus dying or are we dead
screw, nail and peg?
You think a tree 
in a random forest
if it fell at fall
and you fell over 

au-tumn
Did you hear that?

You think 
     for a tree
in a random forest, of any range, range is n
you fall and shout, the sky above you
you think they heard you? You are alone
alone my friend, 
you lol parallel to any ones who like you
any minus one, to be precise 
you'd be surprised, mostly frustrated
it's those edge cases that can drive you nuts
a mere lousy heel, thereby it's all hanging,
whether runs, living or dying
executes, kaching, you hear?
not even, 
whether all or nothing 
it's always that one, it's always you 
sticking out against the frame, aligned off
sticking out, you think you're special?
coo-coo, coo-coo,
good morning sunshine, let me tell you,
there's a word for people like you
the word is you, you, you
or is it I? It's always used so interchangeably.

But let's be clear, there is an I 
I stand above, I tell of nature
and there is a you, like wise, really, irrelevant, 
a figure of speech, if there ever was one,
or may I presume, a figure of p-hoetry, 
though since we did speak on 
one occasion, after another, after an other
than after all, you are for me, 
in a matter of speaking, a figure of speech,

oh haha, but enough about me,
I mean about you,
enough of us about 
you 
like you said 
like you wrote, 
from afar as my song, 
enough of you about
us 
enough of us
I didn't like 
what you said
enough of us enough enough 
enough of you 
that's what you said
but in my words, I put it justly
enough of you, it's been too much
yet not enough, not on time;
Again it's the wrong dimensions
again it's you, the one from earlier
sticking out, rubbing against, let's not mention
you've been too much, that is to say, 
you woulda been in the spring,
I mean I would have, or already been, 
not on time, am *I* dying?
Only one way the wool would wind
or so you'd think, I mean you do, 
but let me tell you, you are off,
what was done can be undone
I can also pull, unwind the spindle,
there will be less, less less, unwind, unwind less
that's what you wanted, didn't you?
In your lucid dream,
you see it clear, a seed, I disappeared
or was it you? or another else 
no, also you, 
for you see, you didn't see
that's not how it would be 
in any case
any minus one 
you'll be there, always there
you /do/ realise? you'll be there too
I mean apart, yes of a whole
but still divided, three or four
autonomous, or even more,
ever and anon comes another 
number with moral feelings––
that's not the point, 
I don't mean "there beside"
I mean there, stuck within you 
stuck inside
you will be there,
and I'll be too, somewhere in the all around us
if not I, some other any body, 
or yes it's I, who would be less, 
unwound unwound less less less
unless, you do remember:
I have lied I have lied
cannot undone the done 
life is not a spindle
the world not a metaphor
the motions go in one direction 
even there where you came from 
first it's hot, then dying, dead
no, but first was life
before it's hot, the early times
I mean spring, we're not dumb
and a further step back, there was a little death
before the times, the nothing of oblivion
ob living, abliving,
the void of the unknown, 
sorry, I lie again
of the never-known, I mean not-yet-known
but you see it would only go one way
supposedly 

but you already know too much, that it's not right,
I mean unjust, it's true, but wrong in its pain
not quite yours, neither theirs
somehow inter-tween, but borne by you:
yes, you have also seen them dying
the spindle turns, in this respect,
what was known becomes unknown,
who has known becomes unknowing,
they cannot communicate 
the words they use it's like a joke
hysterical, had it not been so sad 
the grim of death, stupid grin of the dying
they already forgot, what they just said
Do you remember what you told me?
You gave your word, I gave mine,
had we an accord or a tug of war?
You think it's a cord you could just unwind?
from B sharp all down to A flat
if for the life of me I could sing.
Isn't yours a kind of lying
unkind of lying
lying dead
or lying staring at the ceiling
someone's floor, another life
does it matter going up or trickle down
like a gutter for dead leaves, 
for the snow, dying melted, 
clotted heavy viscosity,
turning forward, moving backwards,
or just lying under a tree
in a random forest
lying to me? to you? to any body?
Which tree, one of two forbidden, 
tree of life or the other, 
tree of the knowledge 
of good and evil? 
Was not the original sin
just a slip of curiosity? 
Regard the malevolent fruit,
behind the fall of
man, of woman, 
of our kind,
not malevolent, only barred 
by the holy ghost,
for which infringement we
were cursed, 
to cover up ourselves in leaves,
to suffer and be banished
from that forest of our dreams.
No harm in turning back,
your back?
Lying spot on A flat is G sharp,
a single note capable of infinite
vibrations, 
Yet only a chord can dissonance 
or coincidence into harmony,
chord with an h, it makes all the difference
the sharp h of Achilles,
though you know too well, you never hear it
not a thunder, not a whisper, nothing nothing
I mean you never speak it, in your tongue, 
not to me, unvocal, to me you're mute, 
blameless, blame less.
So unlike you you wanted me
I mean like unyou, unoccluded and understood, 
be extracted, excluded, plain and voicless.
I explained the ex-lies, out of nothing, 
I exchanged, to unlie but thus relied? 
I unbosomed my stinking fear into you
a refear, vicious respiral, 
isn't it a bit unfair? it's not your solo
and cannot be. It's not the law of men
so to speak, that I advocate,
but the law of nature, mine and any body's.
––Any but one? that one is you?

Let's go back, you said, I said,
what was done can't be undone
it's not a prefix you can stick 
or you can stick it, you told me
I mean unstick it, in other words
but what a difference do your words make? 
Were you lying
silent, secret, elusive, holy whole?
I mean, what a difference two letters make
or merely one
the whole difference between word and world
just an el, just look at that
Almost looks like an I, am I right?  
if it was, it would make world a worrr-- worid 
Just like you were, weren't you? 
Or if you stick a heel to it, for support,
a long tail,
I becomes a small h, and gives us worhd
no I'm kidding,
I mean I was trying to,
help you, make you smile, 
do you follow? you wish you didn't hear the h
you wish to cut it red and heal the ache
you know the el can only stand
held together by adjacent letters
and capital I, I mean you,
even I stands supported from both directions
I mean ends, top and bottom, 
under, above,

 * 

You think you can create the world 
out of nothing, don't you? 
Ex nihilo, you are divine! 
The Jews say, one who saved a life
saved a whole world,
They also sing, 
the entire world is a very narrow bridge
a very narrow bridge
kol ha olma kulo
gesher tsar meod, gesh er tzar meod

You thought you could create the world 
out of the blue, didn't you? 
I can, it's called poetry, 
I stand outside and speak of nature:
The crows cry fire on the tree,
a choir freely envisions danger.
and so can you make that decree,
if you keep your words,
as was at the very beginning
~the holy spirit floated above the aquaface~
it said, "let there be light" and so was light.

For didn't you wish
to go all the way to the beginning,
but oh not in time, one cannot turn it
/you/ don't step back, you step aside
to a parallel, para el, para I 
ay ay ay ay
the bridge too narrow, the bridge too wide,
You think you can see in the abyss of the unknown
find the not yet met of the never known, 
the not yet known?

 * 

You want to have it a la annunciation
the holy spirit, pure, no body
no mind
just a dove, that came and whispered
into your ear, through the hollow canal 
right into your cochlear duct,
your sacred biddings, little birth ab voco:
––– there you have it.

You know the word paráclito, 
the advocate, the mediator, 
the one who stands between you and what you unhave:
One part is para, that means beyond,
that is, different and not the same,
like paradox, or paradies.
The other is kletos, what a word, 
someone invited,
invoked to help, 
funny it must stand, 
stick out there orthogo nail––
I apologize, nobody likes being tickled
I admit, I tried indeed, 
to speak your tongue, and got it wrong,
but let's banish all misunderstandings
Or at least enough, enough of them
What am I doing here, you might wonder, 
tickling again? Standing on the river water 
last old winter, nine months ago,
no not the river
just the Landwehrkanal, there in Kreuzberg
under lying, in the ice
a frozen swan 
just one
can you imagine a more deeplorable death?
It must have been left behind
there must have been others, they don't land from the sky
out of the blue, borne by storks
you already know
swans have no voice, they are mute
they cannot cry, they cannot shout:
cra, cra, wait for me, 
it disappeared into oblivion.
They say birds have short memories
and shorter arms, and no hands
they cannot tug at a cord for light
and if it's night, their flight is in the very blackness
and ifs a swan, it floats away, ab-here, hereless
over the water, like the spirit––

What a gorgeous animal !!
Have you seen it too?
Encased supine, just like you 
sleeping,
in that random forest, 
looking upwards in the sky,
but not dying, neither living, already dead, 
and nonetheless so beautiful 
that people laid roses around it,
scarlet red, yellow red;
they left red, a livid scar, 
a trace of someone that was but isn't;
Or so I suppose, I haven't seen them,
/maybe/ it was never people, 
these were doves who came with roses
carried over held in beaks, 
like the slip of fortune blessing
to show benevolent respect 
unanimous
to that animal
the force of nature.

 * 

I swear I only intended to be thus respectful,
only said as much as proper, 
or as I understood, misunderstanding,
underlying in the ice, 
eyes closed, transparent coffin wide.
And so you laid to me as well, 
a spent even ox-eye daisy
to the dead,
to the blessed, the passed away.
Am I dead or only resting 
supine pining for the fjords?
By an ex parrot, you lay your rose––
While blind black with pent-up rage,
weren't you? Whose emotions are you kicking 
with the heel
You'll always be there
don't you see? Or so will I
or some body

You know the clear landscape you envision
that you hope for: only flat waters before you
the only wind, is your own stirring.
That sharp line is the horizon
how very finite, a mere illusion
So long are the living, dying, living,
it will churn infinite surprises,
the day the night, and all the seasons,
sad, joyous, angry, mad
don't you see?
You'd have to turn in some direction,
and it all would keep on spinning,
and you would not be alone,
an entire world with infantile 
jerks and motions
You know too well, 
what goes east can go west,
and all around, 
so much motion, what a mess,
you know too well
you heard it already
I wanna go, I wanna stay 
and then things part and fall apart
they always were apart
I mean separated, to be exact,
I mean being beyond each other, 
do you see? what goes can always return
return to what? 
you think if you close your eyes it disappears,
like a child's monstrous lamp
or a book shelf, in the dark?
one day, one night the child is grander
narrow but long, wide arm
tugs the light, tacitly, "let there be light,"

 * 

There will be screaming, over a smell of toast,
"who is I, who is you,
who is any body?"
But why screaming, it's all calm, flat water serene,
what do I know, of whose nature?
And what do you?
After all, we're making up,
out of nothing, or so you hope, 
sorry, I misspoke: "before all" and not after
but the host won't go so far,
you want to stay closer
and begin at most,
as the Romans called it, ab ovo, 
this means, "from Leda's egg"
which a swan had lost inside her, 
just a nameless animal, 
less than less, 
dumb and numb,
the world forgetting, 
by the world forgot,
but everybody's gotta learn sometime.

from an egg, Elen af Troy,
from the other, Elena of Berlin, 
The most beautiful, one of two, 
one of three, four, five, 
Paris took her, and escaped,
starting a war, bloody crimson, 
the world was dying, fucking dying
just out of an egg, 
Pandora's box,
don't you see?
It will be so as it always has,
I don't mean war, maybe peace,
but peace is not quietude, I mean unvocal,
if war is wordless screams,
peace is silence made with words
you have to hold like a paradox;
there's that riddle, you already know it,
"say my name and I disappear"

 * 

Paris should know–– whither you go, your heels
carve a trace behind you,
over the snow, over the leaves, 
over the dust, over the ashes,
you can walk, you can run,
you can hide, in a random forest,
but you'll be found, but then again,
you can choose to come back,   
as you did, as any one.
Would /they/? What's fair in war, 
or so they say, is fair in love;
and what's unfair, we'll extrapolate e contrario
in one must too in the other !
Perhaps /you/ think love is a passion, 
like fear, a hard crave 
impossible to avoid in action,
like Paris did, eloping,
holding Helen.
He raves westwards on winged heels 
to the south, the alluring void,
eluding autumn, escape the roots,
the rotting tangle of the woods,
where spring just dyed winter green,
rose from it, anew, pastless, clean.
Pollen blissful in the wind,
flowers bristle through the thin
earth, quiet and serene. 
Where nobody would pluck the petals,
"it is mine, it is not, it is mine, it is not..."
Maledicted Paris, short for Luwian Parizitis,
like Alexander, "defender of men", yet 
where the word and where the world:
shortcoming kidnapper, cowardly killer, 
for your sins you died, rejected.
Were you living when you were bleeding,
scarlet roses, scarlet traces,
were you thus dead when you had stopped?
A day races an others, n plus one, 
n plus two, n plus three,
A month a year in nonending regime––
the sun is unconscious and relentless:
row, 
row, row your boat,
intently down the stream,
it will always overtake you.

 * 

For me, just I perhaps, 
Love is an image, it's a whole
with a few parts, each with its proper role
rolling at a distance, as appropriated,
to create heavenly harmony.
There's little earth, that's where we are 
distance zero, the beginning.
There's the sun, far far away 
lest it burns us, but not too far
just enough, enough, enough
to give life to all around us. 
It seems it's moving, east to west, 
but the astronomers contradict us, 
they say it's only we who are acycle;
they stand above, they think themselves 
like the holy spirit, 
but standing below, what do we see? the world is flat
horizons sharp.
There's the moon, which doesn't shine
Again they say, but a reflection
a magic mirror of the sun, 
when it's unseen
hiding, leaving traces beyond the scene
luscious light, illustrious  
just close enough, 
enough to seem 
grander in proportion
than the sun, and far enough, remote,
mysterious, to write poetry about
"Are you looking at the same moon as me?
I wonder," wondered the poet, 
we'll find out only with words, won't we?

here's the cosmos, an image of motion 
–– splendous, wonderful
there must be god that loves us then
they feel, that God must feel,
no other way,
must be a force to keep all intact,
I don't deny it––
and a word, to keep it apart,
as the skies were from the waters. 
But you won't relie on me? On ourselves?
You think you could, had we known less?
But whence comes confidence?
Con - fidence, trusting together, 
I can dance, maybe not tango,  
but you can teach me, you be the lead
the rose crimson in your mouth,
you set the rhythm, you set the key, 
one step forward, two steps back,
one aside, another roll deflection reroll,
one step north, one step south, 
so much stepping yet as it were,
we never move very far,
it's called dancing, don't you see, 
of the living, of the dying,
of the little con - fused,
you cannot dance alone, ma chérie,
two steps aside, another roll, 
Media luna while minding the shoes,
Moment–– or do you think the moonfull ball
turned me into a loony-tick?
But would you admit it, 
I mean let it come
into our words, 
you were angry like poor Achilles, 
because I had lied
––or seemed to be––
dying, dead, like his friend Patroclus;

Patroclus, a childhood lover, 
Stripped of his armour shell by whom
has torqued a peg into his unwomb.
Protected dead by his paramour
until his ghost came and gave the word,
"let me to the underworld"
and so he was set ablaze:
ringlet auburn locks 
singed autumn scarlet.

as an aside, "Patroclus" means glory to the father, 
like in Cleopatra, the words rearranged.
She had only two grandparents, isn't it nasty?
a dynasty deranged, undertook to generate
out of nothing, with no help, no advocate,
exclusive, holy, whole
alone.
the name no matter,
still without it, a wild connection, 
an inherent inspiration tween
a parent and a child, 
t––––not a parent, just a father, just so to speak,
I mean nothing more by it, just a name to elucidate,
an association, that apparent fatal weakness
itch of mine, of any body, of any mind.

Back to our prostrating Achilles
back above dead friend Patroclus,
was this why he lied weeping with emotion?
Or was it pride that drove his wrath?
Because Hippodameia was promised to him,
the best of men, perfect body, perfect soul,
and then taken away, 
is it /that/ pride that made you suffer
made you angry, agitated ––were you betrayed?
Achilles left the body, took up arms,
blind with rage, rage, oh rage, 
slaughtered half the Trojan army,
not all of them, but just enough
enough enough to clog the river standing
holding water, 
not holding water
water still, but not frozen
coagulated emotionsless
clotted crimson, like the benches,
like the drenches, 
the river stopped.

 * 

Here's where it all began, I mean Achilles,
I mean really any one of us, 
You know the story,
there were other men 
before his conception,
the son was to be grander than the sire,
so he said, a prophecy, the god of fire,
so one turned away, so did the other, 
but grander still is the mother, 
this is just: he did not give it, she's the one who bore it
to her it hurt, and this is key,
I mean the child, she would protect it, 
but tell me: is it pride that led her think, 
she could beget it all alone, out her pinkie, 
like getting tea with a fortune cookie,
pulling her wholesome one by the fetal cord
out the red of the beyond
where a cuckoo bird 
had come at every hour,
had left its egg,
had left and forgotten, forgetting, dead?

Oh no, if 
only 
but 
again 
the heel, by which she held him
sticking out, 
that point of contact, 
that navel scar, 
to hold him, like a word, lest he falls down 
and drowns
in the river of the underworld, without a sound,
the river Styx, the river of time, 
by which all oaths are to be made,
you understand? 
the world is turning, many years ahead,
enough time for Paris's arrow to reach the heel
it only goes in one direction, after the traces
in the snow, on the leaves, 
in the dust, in the ashes,
right where he could be penetrated
thus the beginning, thus the end, 
Achilles died, like he was born.

Thus the egg, ab ovo ad ovo, 
another month the moon is turning, 
that's how the world, at any rate, is rolling, 
was that your worry?
With some patience it will come about,
I mean come in, 
but!
~Of course if you step aside, start anew, 
it will be completely clear,
before the words, before the lies,
have I said too much?
~A new race, here the course is smooth––
what is pride? it's a passion
it's a strife to keep words true
let them adhere to what we do.
Let us be silent, let me be dumb, 
silent, and disappear.

 * 

Only a dead egg turns smoothly, 
by dead I mean obliving, boiled by fire, 
all the parts coagulated,
into a whole, a pebble tomb-stone,
smoothed by silent river running,
down to a mere silver bone,
Silence is hiding, behind a shell–
you think if you cover, if you obfuscate it, 
nothing's there? O~r-- just waiting to be discovered?
Like the future whose nature, 
no prophesy will help you know.

A fresh egg is not so obliging,
it will not turn so nice, 
try yourself, it would not spin,
too many parts in the womb unseen–– 
thus are the living, which are not dead
not easy to manipulate like a mindless piece of ice,
piece of matter,
will it not have to be this way,
a little complicated, bit accomplicated, 

I know I scared you,
never mind me, I no longer matter, 
sadly brevity is not in my repertoire, 
that's my innate passion, that's one weakness
this is where I always fall:
an irresistible urge to express
to those who looked me in the eyes.
You sense I had a special one on you?
Like the sun, who shines on us,
blinding bright;
whom it visits, gone?
Invisible in presence, so in absence?
Could Paris really have imagined
America? Could Achilles? Could that god of fire?
To him there was but ocean after ocean––
No, actually, there was nothing,
if his emotions were an actor.
Out of sight, out of mind,
that is, non existing, or so it seems,
that is –– unseems, 
and what you do see, what you saw,
what you're seeing, that's too much
I'm too much, too much too near, 
para much, surplus excess,
or not enough, at one point you thought, 
This is what doves truly fear? 
the unruly scarecrow pulls another trick
the stick figure grows two feet, 
throws a feat, rips unjustly what he sowed, 
this figure of speech would take what you owned, 
which is yours,
like Paris took Helen of Troy,
Like Agamemnon took Briseis,
Like Zeus took Leda,
You know who you are, 
I'm talking to
You always have
been so sure 
that this is you, 
you think you're special
you are so fucking special 
two, out of six, eight nine,
range is n, 
And I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo 
What the hell am I doing here?
Where I don't belong.
So long, 

There she goes whole, no
unwhole, but a part, without the part 
she parts wholly
You don't have to part completely, 
You said, I mean, you meant, We don't have to, 
But the turn you made, a jerk unforeseen
undoing, unprophesying–––
I wish I was special
I mean, I wish I will be, 
Would have been, 
small but special, 
like a Sunday waking when it had been raining, 
or a cat with a mean face,
or a carpet matching socks, 
or sun rays through the fog, 
or a childhood smell when adult
or like autumn, 
I will willingly step aside,
As you will teach me, as we will learn,
Perhaps we danced a little off,
I mean I did step on some toes, 
I only came as close as invited, 
won't you agree?
Oh how hard to initiate a dance
coordinate, all the limbs
we can arrange, we can improve,
It's a plan, if you approve,
I step aside, you make your roll
counter clockwise, clock unwind
but I know I've already scarred you
cannot take back what's already behind
cannot unsay, unmute, unlie, undo
you said you won't deal with me
if that's your wish, 
–I /had/ put down my cards,
but you cannot play the game alone, 
––––Oh not a game,
another metaphor,
never mind me, 
I lied again, reliably: in a way, the world indeed
is a metaphor.

meta means across, beyond, 
like in metaphysics, metamorphosis

phor comes from "to carry" 
Like in Christopher who bore 
the god child over his shoulders
across the river, 
like Aeneas did his father
fleeing the bloody war in Troy
you save a soul, you saved the world
--–– Or like in euphoria
Eu is good, at least in Greek,
so together it means,
so fucking good you are carried away 

You see how it's a metaphor?
the world that is standing between us?
it's beyond, we are apart,
I mean separated, 
yet the world mediates, 
it's the space that would carry
what you'll end up bearing,
would carry us and every one
beyond ourselves, beyond the now 
through each chronology.
For you see? without the world, 
you cannot generate a stranger,
can only redo your self, self, self
Too didactic, my apology, 
you already knew all that
didn't you? You've learned of spaces 
you are their master, you can better than
hit and run, as a tactic
Let's draft a strategy 
if you pick back your pencil, draw larger lines, 
you can teach me how to move around you
one step forward, two steps behind,
You dance alone only in your mind,
where it would never matter––
in the world, you need a floor
you're not a spirit, only frozen river could carry
your heels as they wo-ap slip from side to side;
another life: toes to watch out for, 
Oh oops, that's me, hello, 
Sorry, I get carried away, bad Mark, 
not evil, I mean, not good for.

This is just that to me–––
My pops Eugene son of Isaac said
everything should be splendid in a person 
more exactly, прекрасно
that comes from "пре" like para, beyond
and "красно" which meant beautiful
and now means red, the warmest
color of the living, the not yet dead

All one on the street nature appears 
alone
that's oh kai, that is life,
is lonely if we don't put a word to some body
direct attention, entertain a thought,
observe the motions, pluck a cord, 
I play with words, I mean no harm, 
isn't it how we learn to dance
play to under stand in line, 
slide in circle harmony.
Never mind me child, I would leave, 
you don't need my company,
when standing in this autumn instant,
to see the beautiful existing:
the leaves that are dying vain
in gold and silver,
yellow around the birches, yellow by the ditches,
on the hoods, on the sidewalk,
yellow lines, stirred straight by car rides,
scarlet on the vines on the houses wrapping drains
scarlet under the skin, scarlet in the rushed
like blood scarlet heart rate red veins, 
scarlet in the swan's vain scat
sca, sca 
it announces merrily 
merrily merrily merrily:
this is it, 
a little swan song
for the end
of another season
another round, of the earth 
around the sun
whose ashen light 
ever dimmer
every morning, 
behind congealing clouds,
