Originally I devised it to be a slowly unfolding but otherwise "regular blog" with essays being published sequentially, but then I decided to design it after [Gwern's model](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) and have all essays easily accessible from a single menu, while each essay is presented as a work in progress and will be incrementally edited and appended to over time. 

It was an interview with Yuval Harari that prompted me to work towards erectig this here blog. I learned much from his lectures, and I agree with him on many points, but on several interwiews he presented a view on consciousness that I found to be false and which spurred me to put in writing my own opinion on the matter. 

I have only a very limited time for writing, so my approach towards the goal will be slow. Before I tackle the raison d'être problem I shall write up what I deem to be preliminary essays, though among these will be some that are, frankly, off the main topic but which are simply interesting for me. 

I’m also writing the blog [ankieverything](http://ankieverything.wordpress.com/) which is about the application of spaced repetition to domains other than dictionary words (but those also).

Mark.
